    DESDEO: the open source framework
  </h2>
  <p>
    DESDEO is an <em>open source framework for interactive
    multiobjective optimization methods</em>. DESDEO contains implementations
    of some interactive methods and modules that can be utilized to
    implement further methods.
  </p>  
  <p>
    In multiobjective optimization, several
    conflicting objective functions are to be  optimized
    simultaneously. Because of the conflicting nature of the objectives,
    it is not possible to obtain individual optima of the objectives
    simulatneously but one must trade-off between the
    objectives. Interactive methods are iterative by nature where a
    decision maker (who has substance knowledge) can direct the solution
    process with one's preference information to find the most preferred
    balance between the objectives. In interactive methods, the amount of
    information to be considered at a time is limited and, thus, the
    cognitive load set on the decision maker is not too
    demanding. Furthermore, the decision maker learns about the
    interdependencies among the objectives and also the feasibility of
    one's preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mission of DESDEO is to increase awarenss of the benefits of
    interactive methods make interactive methods more easily
    available and applicable. Thanks to the open architecture, interactive
    methods are easier to be 
    utilized and further developed. The framework consists of
    reusable components that can be utilized for 
    implementing new methods or modifying the existing methods. The
    framework is released under a 
    permissive open source license.

  <p>
    The interactive methods currently implemented in DESDEO are the
  synchronous NIMBUS method

    <p>
      DESDEO is an Academy of Finland funded research project (grant number
      287496). The project lasts for four years (August 2015 - August 2019) and
      aims to bring interactive methods closer to researchers and practitioners
      world-wide, by providing them with implementations of interactive
      optimization methods. The main results of the DESDEO project are
      published as the DESDEO open source optimization framework with
      implementations of the new methods developed during the project, of
      implementations of methods developed earlier as well as connections to
      different simulation and problem modeling tools.

    <p>
      Many of the publications produced as part of the project are available <a
        href="http://www.mit.jyu.fi/optgroup/publications.html">on the
        publications page of the University of Jyväskylä Optimization Group</a>
      and <a href="http://users.jyu.fi/~miettine/publ.html">on the publications
        page of Prof. Kaisa Miettinen</a>.
    </p>
