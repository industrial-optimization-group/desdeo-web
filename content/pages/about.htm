  DESDEO: Decision Support for Computationally Demanding Optimization Problems
</h2>
<p>
  DESDEO is an <em>open source framework for interactive
  multiobjective optimization methods</em>. DESDEO contains implementations
  of some interactive methods and modules that can be utilized to
  implement further methods.
</p>  
<p>
  In multiobjective optimization, several
  conflicting objective functions are to be  optimized
  simultaneously. Because of the conflicting nature of the objectives,
  it is not possible to obtain individual optima of the objectives
  simulatneously but one must trade-off between the
  objectives. Interactive methods are iterative by nature where a
  decision maker (who has substance knowledge) can direct the solution
  process with one's preference information to find the most preferred
  balance between the objectives. In interactive methods, the amount of
  information to be considered at a time is limited and, thus, the
  cognitive load set on the decision maker is not too
  demanding. Furthermore, the decision maker learns about the
  interdependencies among the objectives and also the feasibility of
  one's preferences.
</p>
<p>
  The mission of DESDEO is to increase awarenss of the benefits of
  interactive methods make interactive methods more easily
  available and applicable. Thanks to the open architecture, interactive
  methods are easier to be 
  utilized and further developed. The framework consists of
  reusable components that can be utilized for 
  implementing new methods or modifying the existing methods. The
  framework is released under a 
  permissive open source license.

<p>
  The interactive methods currently implemented in DESDEO are the
synchronous NIMBUS method

  DESDEO is also a  research project funded by the Academy of Finland
  (grant number 287496). The project lasts for four years (August 2015 -
  August 2019).   The project aims to bring interactive methods closer
  to researchers and practitioners world-wide, by providing them with
  implementations of interactive optimization methods. The main results
  of the 
  DESDEO project are published as the DESDEO open source optimization framework
  with implementations of the new methods 
  developed during the project, of implementations of methods developed
  earlier as well as connections to different 
  simulation and problem modeling tools.
